Requirements:

- To load models properly, save using pytorch for smoothest compatibility
- Adjust final code snippet that gathers the recommendations/relevant items for model to run properly

Note:
- Included Node2Vec and BERT model code snippets as an example, can be adjusted for whichever models are being run
